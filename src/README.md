# Sudoku solver

A sudoku solver that I wrote on a plane ride.

To run

```
cargo run -- <filename>
```

This takes a file that is the number grid for the sudoku puzzle, where "x" is a cell that is empty at the start of the puzzle.

For example:

```
x1xxx6xxx
7xx3xx8x5
xxxxxx79x
17x5xxxx9
9x3x27xx8
xxx1xxxxx
8x5xx1x3x
xxx97xx8x
xxxxx59x2
```
